firebase database messaging - store messages 
    asker and answerer
    asker - question is stored in database
    

FIRESTORE SETUP:
    questions -
        message - points to document in messages with current thread on this question (should only show up in explore section if message tab is empty)
        user - user that made this question
    user -
        phone number associated with user
        rating number associated with user
        uid
    messages -
        key is uids of the two users in convo (maybe seperated by something idk?) - asker id first or something
        actual messages stored here

notes:
    setup a new messages document when an answerer sends a message to the asker
    this document is deleted when the asker is done talking to the answerer
    user id and phone number?

NEXT STEP: notifications -> authentication rules -> encryption | asthetics, add in alert messages to errors

in notifications: store user id and token id

https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification

use lottie for the chai animation
limit titles/questions to 200 characters
check for authentication in app.js - no need to open the setup screen for no reason

cloud function for notifications - convo on create, convo on message update, convo on pending create - notify a random user

REMOVE alot of the listeners, just make requests and if they come back null, pop up - only have listeners for cards and messages

ONLY HAve read write access to convos in you convo list and pending convos
only 2 users allowed to be authenticated for normal convo - these users can never be changed
can see what phone number wrote what? - no because we'll use the id from firestore authentication - so all ids are anonymous
can see which conversations were written by the same person - fine then we can encrypt all the text stored in the database

https://www.npmjs.com/package/hybrid-crypto-js#documentation

only create/delete access for conversations
only update access for rating 
only authenticated users can change ratings/convo lists
check if the user has the conversation in their list of convos before rating, users dont know convo ids - convo ids are linked to people
FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser().getUid();
pending convos give read access but write access only to og_user
users dont have access to write to their own rating, only read
other users can write and read to ratings?
only the users themselves can delete conversations, if they dont have access/the convo no longer exists the user should delete

SO other users can add convos to other users, and -for now- write to the rating of other users


only write to 

og_user gives new_user permission to read/write - they own the document


    **MAKE EVERYTHING FASTER WITH ASYNC CALSS
    Pending Convos have a field which represents the user it's notified

    MAKE ALL FIREBASE CALLS ASYNCHRONOUS
    eventually - users have ratings, when selecting a user from user collection sort by rating and users have notified section false

    MAKE RH
