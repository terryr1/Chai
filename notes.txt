PENDING REFACTOR:

NEXT TITLE: IMPROVE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH conversation __IMPORTANT__

make an index on a boolean field called pending - then get where pending = true

NEXT STEP: notifications ->  encryption | asthetics, add in alert messages to errors

SET LIMITS FOR NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS YOU CANN HAVE ASSIGNED TO YOU, LIMIT CONVERSATIONS TO 500 messages, limit convos to 20, 
make sure to limit gets as much as possible look through the code
minimize errors in firestore functions - this will probably slow stuff down if there are errors

speed everything up by rendering messages before the request gets sent out

BATCH READ convo messages - only read like 20 at a time unlesss they scroll up or something

CHANGE NAME OF USERS AND COLLECTIONS IN PRODUCTION TO 77447_chaitheapp_users and 77447_chaitheapp_conversations
that way people don't know how to query, also keep all your code private

ADD TRANSACTIONS TO CLOUD FUNCTIONS

in notifications: store user id and token id ?

use lottie for the chai animation
limit titles/questions to 200 characters

cloud function for notifications - convo on create, convo on message update, convo on pending create - notify a random user

can see which conversations were written by the same person - fine then we can encrypt all the text stored in the database

    **MAKE EVERYTHING FASTER WITH ASYNC CALSS

    MAKE ALL FIREBASE CALLS ASYNCHRONOUS
    eventually - users have ratings, when selecting a user from user collection sort by rating and users have notified section false
    if deciding against this, delete the rarting field?

Messages should be created with timestamp - then send them - this way it can be loaded faster as well and timestamp is accurate
remove npm modules we don't use anymore (there's a few)
